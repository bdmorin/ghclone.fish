# ghclone.fish
simple fish function for how I like to clone repositories

just type `ghclone [https://github.com/bdmorin/ghclone.fish.git]` and it will create a small directory structure and clone to it.

I wanted to write a fisher plugin.

#todo
 - write tests
 - write completion
 - integrate [gws](https://streakycobra.github.io/gws/)
 - maybe write a charm.sh/glow wrapper for fun
